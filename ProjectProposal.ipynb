We would like to use .drop() to process the rows with a price over 450000. And for the second one, we want to drop other columns of variables as we only want the one about time period. Regarding the third dataset, we want to use only the data in CA to proceed our research. Thus, we want to sort and keep the data of CA only.\n",

Then we should analyse those diagrams directly in three ways to extract informations from them, such as: 1) the outliers, 2) the distribution, and 3) the variance of the data.\n",

Our dataset does not involve any personal information such as name, phone number or zip-code, thus we do not have to deal with privacy concerns.\n",

There will be other geographical factors such as neighbor crime rate or other geographical features such as proximity to lake, mountain or nearest elementary school that affect housing prices. We plan to focus on finding the correlation between house pricing, amount of bedrooms and use simply the proximity to ocean as an additional factor to minimize the influence of this potentially biased factor on our prediction model."

    "If our analyses and hypotheses are correct, we have successfully found a prediction model on house pricing. The prediction model contributes to the housing market, since it can be used for all customers who intend to buy or rent a house that is relatively cheaper in the neighborhood. We also hope to find the cheapest time period in the house market. House owners can also estimate the value of their real estates using our model. Similarly, the approach we will take can be used in similar fields, such as car market.\n",

Then if the method still does not match our current dataset, we will try to find a supplementary or an alternative dataset to work with.

    "\n",
    "One potential confound of our data is cultural influence. Since our data does not include any personal information, we have no information on the cultural background of the households. It is possible that some neighborhoods consist householders with similar cultural background, and people from this cultural background tend to spend more or less than others on housing. Since this does not apply to the majority of people, we did not take this factor into consideration."
